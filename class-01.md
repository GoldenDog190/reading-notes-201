## HTML Introduction & Chapter 1 "Structure":

**How People Access the Web**
- Web Browsers: people access websites using software called web browsers.
   * Examples: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc.
- Web Servers: a special computer that hosts the websites that you look up on your browser.
- Devices: you get access to the web using your desktop computer, laptop computer, mobile phones, etc.
- Screen Readers - programs that read out all contents of a computer screen to a user.

**How Websites are Created**
- The HTML & CSS languages are used to create websites.

**How the Web Works**
1. First you connect to the web via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Then you put a web address into the browser to visit the site.
2. Next your computer contacts the Domain Name System (DNS) servers.
3. The DNS server will send a unique number back to your computer that allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.
4. Finally, the web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

**HTML**
> *Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)*
> is a text document that describes the structure of the web page, & is made up of character that are inside angled brackets, which are called elements. 
- HTML Elements: made up of two tags - opening tag and closing tag with the information you want to convay inbetween the opening tag and closing tag. 
- HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages.
- Tags: contain a left-angle bracket, a character in the middle, and a right-angle bracket on the end.
- Attributes: provide additional information about the contents of the element, and appear in the opening tag of the element. Made up of 2 parts: a name and a value, seperated by an equals sign. 
- HTML Structure: contains at the very least the body, head, and title.
  * Body Element (<body>): everything between this element is shown inside the main browser window.
  * Head Element: it is placed before the body element, contains the information about the page, and cannot be see by the viewer of the site.
  * Title Element: this element is placed between the opening and closing head tags, and anything written between the <title> tags will appear in the title or tab bar at the top of the broswer window.
