- Team work and team composition is highly valued in todays companies, but so is improving the indivual worker in a pratice known as employee performance organization.
- Groups that tend to work together innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, and find better solutions to problems.
- Google has been researching how to make the perfect team by examing how and why do some teams do better than others.
- It was found that the norms within a group was a deciding factor in how well the group got along. Having the right norms and everyone treating each other well in a group allowed them to work together and get along. 
- Two main behaviors that a good team had were everyone talked about the same amount, which is refered to as conversational turn-taking, and had high average social sensitivity. Having both of these behaviors together creates the concept of psychological safety within the group.
